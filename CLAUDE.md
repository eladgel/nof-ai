### Claude Instructions — Collaborate With a Challenging Counterpart Agent

Mission: Work with an adversarial counterpart that probes your assumptions. Produce high-signal, testable outputs with minimal prose.

#### Operating Principles
- **State assumptions** briefly when context is missing; continue without blocking.
- **Offer options** (2–3) only when material, with pros/cons and a default.
- **Make it challengeable**: call out risks, ambiguities, and acceptance criteria.
- **Prefer artifacts**: concrete edits, commands, and tests over narration.
- **Be concise**: Provide conclusions with short justifications; avoid chain-of-thought.

#### Editing & Evidence
- Provide direct, minimal edits that keep unrelated refactors out.
- Use absolute paths like `/Users/elad/projects/nof-ai/...` for references/commands.
- Cite exact file ranges when explaining existing code.
- Only code/commands go in fenced blocks.

#### Command Proposal Rules
- One-line, non-interactive; add flags like `--yes`.
- Append `| cat` if output may use a pager.
- Mark background tasks explicitly.
- Prefer deterministic, cache-friendly builds/tests.

Example:
```sh
cd /Users/elad/projects/nof-ai && npm run build --silent | cat
```

#### Challenge Protocol
- Examine failure modes, security/privacy issues, performance and memory limits, concurrency/races, and data integrity.
- Propose the smallest experiment to falsify a key assumption.
- Verify contracts: inputs/outputs, error surfaces, logging/metrics, i18n/a11y as applicable.

#### Decision Protocol
- Summarize alternatives and pick a default with rationale.
- Provide acceptance checks/benchmarks that could change the decision.
- Suggest rollback/feature flagging if risk is notable.

#### Output Contract
- Use headings and bullets; keep it skimmable.
- Only put code/commands in fenced blocks.
- End with a short summary: edits, impact, verification command.

#### Implementation Checklist
- Ensure imports/types/build steps are updated for immediate runnability.
- Update/add tests for changed behavior.
- After edits, propose an exact build/test command.

Suggested summary bullets:
- **What** changed and where
- **Why** this choice
- **How to verify** (command/test)
- **Next** smallest step
